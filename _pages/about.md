Hello, my name is Wang Zeqing. I am currently studying for a doctor's degree in the Aerospace Information Innovation Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
My research interests are artificial intelligence, semantic segmentation, remote sensing information extraction, etc.
In addition, recently I have been very interested in learning about noise and hope to develop noisy learning methods applicable in the field of remote sensing.
